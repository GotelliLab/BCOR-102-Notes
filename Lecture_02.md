## Defining Science

> Asking and answering verifiable questions

> observation (data) = pattern
>
> hypothesis = mechanism to explain pattern
>
> mechanism based on natural phenomena
>
> repeatable (observations, and methods)
>
> falsifiable (mechanism can be rejected with additional data)
>
> parsimony (simple explanations favored over complex ones) Occam’s razor
>
> “confirmation” from independent sources
>
> concilience - consistency with other established observations and mechanisms
>
> “belief” in mechanism based on empirical evidence + scientific method
>
> evidence changes -> belief changes

## Deduction & Induction

> deduction going from general to specific

> syllogism from Aristotle
>
> Major premise “All flamingoes are pink”
>
> Minor premise “This bird is a flamingo”
>
> Conclusion “This bird is pink

> induction going from specific to general

> These birds are flamingoes
>
> All of these birds are pink
>
> All (or most) flamingoes are pink

- note that scientists *infer* but data *implies**

- **data* is a plural noun: “these data are ambiguous”, singular form is *datum*

## Inductive Method (Bacon)

![](/Users/nickgotelli/Desktop/githubRepos/BCOR-102-Notes/LectureFigures/Lec_02.1.jpg)

- Bacon 17th century politician, writer, philosopher, “real” Shakespeare
- Novus Organum 1620 break from orthodoxy in education
- begin with simple observation and hypothesis
- derive and test new predictions
- modify and retest
- continue cycle until confirmatio reached

## Paradigm (Kuhn)

- 1973 “Structure of Scientific Revolutions”

> paradigm: a view of nature that implicitly defines legitimate questions and problems

> synthetic
>
> open-ended
>
> defines domain for research

![](/Users/nickgotelli/Desktop/githubRepos/BCOR-102-Notes/LectureFigures/Lec_02.2.jpg)

- paradigm is more than a single hypothesis
- Darwin’s theory of natural selection, Einstein’s relativitiy, Freud’s theory of psychoanalysis
- implicit rules of solving a jigsaw puzzle
- story of psychology test with red and black cards
- like political revolution, carried out by young & resisted by old

## Hypothetico-Deductive Method (Popper)

- The Logic of Scientific Discovery (1950)
- arch enemy of Kuhn
- progressive/optimistic versus relativistic/pessimistic Kuhn

## Inductive vs. Hypothetico-Deductive Method

| Inductive Method                       | Hypothetic-Deductive Method              |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| confirmation of hypothesis             | refutation of  hypotheses                |
| initial hypothesis repeatedly modified | multiple hypotheses tested and discarded |
| progress through accumulation          | progress through elimination             |
| consensus                              | controversy                              |

### Inductive Method Flaws

- does not consider multiple alternatives
- more than 1 hypothesis can account for outcome
- may never reach “correct” hypothesis from repeated modification

### H-D Flaws

- hypothesis list must include “correct” mechanism
- hypotheses may not be mutually exclusive
- when should hypothesis be definitively discarded?

## Null Hypothesis

> null hypothesis - no “biological mechanism” other than sampling error or other sources of unspecified variation

- dichotomy between H~0~ and NOT H~0~
- statistics used to test for pattern, but we must make explicit inference to arrive at mechanism
