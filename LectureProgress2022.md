### \#1 Introduction 

### Monday, 29 August

> Got through basic course logistics, but did not actually cover course content of Population & Community Ecology, Micro & Macroevolution or distinctions between basic and applied science. Will pick these up later when we get into Ecology material.



### \#2 Philosophy of Science

### Wednesday, 31 August

> Got through all of the materials and just barely introduced null hypothesis. Did not ask questions about what is science, but just jumped into features.



### \#3 Statistics 

### Friday, 2 August 

> Got only through p-value definition. Still need to cover logic flow chart, determinants of statistical p value, empirical example from problem set, and Type I and Type II statistical errors.



### # Labor Day Holiday

### Monday, 3 August



### # 4 Statistics II

### Wednesday, 7 September

> Finished biological hypotheses, example problem, determinants of statistical p, Type I and Type II errors. Introduced ecology definitions (from lecture #1) and defined population. Just at the edge of starting the math.



### # 5 Exponential Growth

### Friday, 9 September

> Finished exponential growth, except for assumptions and significance.



### # 6 Logistic Growth 

### Monday, 12 September

> Completed exponential growth, and the logistic growth through harvesting and maximum yield.



### # 7 Logistic Growth II

### Wednesday, 14 September

> Finished logistic growth. Started Age Structured growth through age terminology, iteroparous, semelparous definitions



### # 8 Age Structured Growth

### Friday, 16 September

> Finished age structured growth, except for stationary and stable age distributions.



### # Exam I

### Monday, 19 September



### # 9 Life History Strategies

### Wednesday, 21 September

> Stationary and stable age distributions, then life history strategies through start of body size effects on r.
