### \#1 Introduction 

### Monday, 29 August

> Got through basic course logistics, but did not actually cover course content of Population & Community Ecology, Micro & Macroevolution or distinctions between basic and applied science. Will pick these up later when we get into Ecology material.

### \#2 Philosophy of Science

### Wednesday, 31 August

> Got through all of the materials and just barely introduced null hypothesis. Did not ask questions about what is science, but just jumped into features.

### \#3 Statistics 

### Friday, 2 August 

> Got only through p-value definition. Still need to cover logic flow chart, determinants of statistical p value, empirical example from problem set, and Type I and Type II statistical errors.
