- Emmy (no feeding, no other animals)

- me and Emma (lecture questions), TA (lab questions), Erin (scheduling questions)

## Course Materials

- Textbook `A Primer of Ecology`
- course notes (second half of course)
- lab manual - on Blackboard
- your own lecture notes

## Lecture Structure

- begin with music (Allman Brothers)
- no powerpoint or videos
- writing on a notepad
- ask questions - a key ingredient for good science!
- could deviate from lecture schedule 
- office hours right after class and on Tuesdays (explain structure)

## Lab Structure

- each lab starts with a quz - no makeups or late quizzes be on time
- initial presentation by lead TA
- lab exercise
- assignments due as listed must be before that next lab starts (usually 1 or 2 weeks in advance)
- using R as a language

## Exam Structure

- 4 midterm exams through semester

- each exam mix of short answers, problems, definitions

- 100 points, 4 pages in length, last page has 8 definitions, each worth 3 points. no letter grades, just the points

- see posted previous exams - new answer key provided this year

- each midterm covvers material since last midterm

- straightford structure, but accuracy in answers for full credit

- closed book, must know your stuff and how to use your calculator

- hand graded by me and the TAs together

- grade challenges in person - bring to office hours or set up meeting

- > Exam I Monday September 19
  >
  > Exam II Friday October 7
  >
  > Exam III Monday October 31
  >
  > Exam IV Wednesday November 16

- lowest midterm exam score will be dropped

- no make up exams. Access students must make arrangements ahead of time, not retroactively.

- no make up exams for athletic events

- end of course and final exam

- > Final Review Session Thursday December 8 6-9 pm
  >
  > Last Day of Class Friday December 9
  >
  > Final Eam Monday December 12 1:30 - 4:15 pm

- final exam same length and structure as midterms
- final exam cumulative covers entire course, (Exams 1 - 4) plus material since Exam 4
- final exam cannot be dropped or rescheduled

## Grade Assignments

> Midterms = 300 points
>
> Final Exam = 100 points
>
> Lab Assignments = 150 points
>
> Total = 550 points

- traditional grade assignments based on your percentage of the total 550 points
- A 90 - 100, B = 80 - 89, C = 70 - 79, etc.
- no rounding of percentages 79.99% = C+ 80.00% = B-
- these are guaranteed limits.
- we reserve right to adjust those levels, but only to lower them. So, any adjustment will help your grade, never hurt it
- “interior” cutpoints  (A-, A, A+) based on where we see natural breaks in the distributions 
- point penalties for late lab assignments, detailed in lab

## Student Behavior

- start promptly at 2:20, so don’t show up late
- don’t talk or be disruptive
- don’t use phones, tablets, or computers unless they are for taking notes
- I appreciate that I speak at a rapid clip; recording lectures for personal use is fine
- Show same respect and courtesy to TAs that you show to me
- zero tolerance for cheating; in 30 years, only 1 major cheating incident, which occurred during covid remote teaching. I refer you to UVM’s Code of Student Conduct for more details
- no notes or stored formulas for exams, doing your own work, not working collectively on solo assignments, not using material inappropriately from internet.
- in lab, closed-toe shoes, long pants, no food, no drink

## How To Succeed In BCOR 102

- attend every lecture
- complete all assignments and tests
- sit in the front
- ask questions and participate in class
- get help when you need it
- visit office hours
- plug into science culture
  - weekly department seminars Mondays noon 101 Stafford
  - weekly graduate student seminars Fridays noon 101 Stafford

## What I will provide

- dynamic engaging lectures (not always entertaining)
- It is what I do and what I enjoy
- some people say that it is the best course they have had at UVM
- how many pre-professionals?
- could be lost to the discipline
- some students passionate about ecology, but not happy with the quantitative focus in this course

## Course Content

- > Ecology: study of distribution (where species occur) and abundance (number of individuals)

  > Ecology vs. Environmental Science
  >
  > Physics vs. Engineering
  >
  > Curiosity-based research vs. applications-based research

  > - Population Ecology - what controls the number of individuals in a population of a single species in time and space?
  > - Community Ecology - what conttrols the number of species in time and space?

  > Evolution: the study of changes in the allele frequencies of a population through time
  >
  > - Microevolution - mechanisms that cause short-term changes in allele frequencies through time (= population genetics)
  > - Macroevolution - long-term consequences of microevolution
  >   - speciation
  >   - sexual reproduction
  >   - altruism

## What Is Science

- repeatable
- falsifiable
- parsimonious
- confirmation from independent sources of data
- consilience (concordance and convergence with existing knowledge)
