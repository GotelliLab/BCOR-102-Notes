## Defining Science

> Asking and answering verifiable questions



> observation (data) = pattern
>
> hypothesis = mechanism to explain pattern
>
> mechanism based on natural phenomena
>
> repeatable (observations, and methods)
>
> falsifiable (mechanism can be rejected with additional data)
>
> parsimony (simple explanations favored over complex ones) Occam’s razor
>
> “confirmation” from independent sources
>
> concilience - consistency with other established observations and mechanisms
>
> “belief” in mechanism based on empirical evidence + scientific method
>
> evidence changes -> belief changes

## Deduction & Induction

> deduction going from general to specific

> syllogism from Aristotle
>
> Major premise “All flamingoes are pink”
>
> Minor premise “This bird is a flamingo”
>
> Conclusion “This bird is pink

> induction going from specific to general

> These birds are flamingoes
>
> All of these birds are pink
>
> All (or most) flamingoes are pink
